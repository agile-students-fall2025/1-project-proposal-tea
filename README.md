# Project Proposal
### Project title

DineWise

### What and why?

The software system is a food recommendation system with an LLM backend, most likely using agentic AI. With so many types of food available, it can be difficult to choose what you want to eat. People also have specific caloric intake goals, allergies, and other dietary restrictions. Users of title can make use of the program to help them decide what to eat. 

### For whom?

- People with allergies, diabetes, or other dietary restrictions. 
- People with decision fatigue that have difficulty deciding what to eat.
- People looking to improve their diets.

### How?

At its core, the system will allow users to use text inputs to ask for what to eat and subsequently generate a response based on the input. 
For the most basic function, a user logged in or not should be able to input text to ask for food recommendations. 
The user should also be able to create a profile that is saved by the system, remembering their preferences and restrictions. This profile can also hold more permanent generated responses like diet plans or restricted foods. 

### Scope

The program is good for a multi-month project becase it contains many potential functions that can be dropped or added at will. The program can have profiles, single-food item answers, cuisine type answers, and more. While the most basic function is just an LLM chatbot, functions can be continously tacked on and iterated upon. For example, the result can also use illustrations, adding another way for the project to be extended. 
Different parts of the program can also be worked on by different people: front-end development for the webapp, back-end development for connecting the LLM to the program, as well as users to a database. The AI should also be specifically trained for the app's purposes. Since features can be easily tacked on, each section will also have to be expanded upon over the course of the semester.
